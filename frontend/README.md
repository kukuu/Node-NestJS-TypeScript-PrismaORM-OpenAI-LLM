This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Key fixes made:

1. Added comprehensive error logging with console.log at each step

2. Added response status checking to catch HTTP errors

3. Added retry button in error state

4. Removed API key header since backend likely doesn't need it

5. Added character count in the title

6. Added empty state when no characters are available

7. Set up the environment: Added enhanced logging, to main.tsx to enable CORS, and also  included optimising the templates to read visual logs. Added RETRY and TEST CONNECTION buttons in the frontend page.tsx for enhanced error handling.I have patched the ports. Allowing 3002 for the backend and 3000/3001 for the frontend.
